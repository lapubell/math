# Do Math From The Terminal

I keep opening up a calculator app to do basic math, and I'm lazy. So, here's a program so that I can just do the math from the command line.

## Examples

math --help (show the help)
math 1 2 (Output is 3, this program assumes addition)
math 5 + 11 (Output is 16)
math 50 - 8 (Output is 42)
math 40+2 (Output is 42, white space is optional if you want to skip it)
